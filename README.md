# Finding the Largest Number in a Circularly Shifted Sorted Array

## Introduction

This repository contains a Python program that addresses the problem of finding the largest number in an array that has been circularly shifted to the right. The array is initially sorted and then shifted by k positions. The goal is to achieve this with a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the array. The elements of the array are assumed to be distinct.

## Problem Statement

Suppose you are given an array A of n sorted numbers that has been circularly shifted to the right by k positions. Write a Python program to find the largest number in A with the specified time complexity.

## Instructions

- Use the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of your choice to write the code.
- Ensure that your single Python file (`find_largest_number.py`) can be executed outside the IDE environment with no dependency on any other file.
- Read input samples from the file named `find_largest_number_input.txt` in the same directory as your program (uploaded here).
- Your code should process each line of input samples separately. First, print out the array in a line itself (e.g., `Array: 35, 42, 5, 15, 27, 29`), and then in a new line print the answer (e.g., `Max: 42`). Repeat the process for every line of the input file.
- Do not write the answer to a file; it is not needed.
- Do not use built-in functions for sorting or finding the maximum; follow the guidelines discussed in class and related slides.

## Execution

To execute the program, run the following command:

```bash
python find_largest_number.py
```

Ensure that the `find_largest_number_input.txt` file is present in the same directory.
